# Supermarket-Sales-Analysis

A supermarket is self-service shop offering a wide variety of food, beverages and household products, organized into sections. It is larger and has a wider selection than earlier grocery stores, but is smaller and more limited in the range of merchandise than a hypermarket or big-box market.

In this Data Science project, I have used different techniques to analyse the sales data set of supermarket.

1.Relation of customers with SuperMarket.

2.Payment methods used in supermarket.
